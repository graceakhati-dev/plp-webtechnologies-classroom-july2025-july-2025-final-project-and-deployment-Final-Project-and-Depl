                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Skipperz Club Nairobi started with a simple idea: that getting fit should be fun, free, and accessible to everyone. What began as a few friends skipping rope at the John Michuki Memorial Park in Nairobi has grown into a vibrant community of fitness enthusiasts of all ages and backgrounds.</p>
                <p>We believe in the power of community to motivate and inspire. Our mission is to provide a welcoming, non-judgmental space for individuals to improve their health, learn new skills, and make lasting friendships.</p>
